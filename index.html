                <p class="lead"><p> My name is Eric Malley and I am 26 years old. For the last five years, I have been working in the music indursty has an audio engineer. I would travel all across the tri-state area, producing live audio and visual effects for thousands of people at a time. My responsibilties included rigging a PA system and finding the correct angles for the best sound coverage, patching and making sure that all of the intrustments were mic'ed and returning signal to the mixing console, and finally mix the band and enjoy the show!</p> 
  
              <p>Although the sound of the last five years seems like something like a "rock stars life" it was quite the opposite. Which is why I am changing my carrer and trying to become a software devoloper. I have always been intrested in technology, and the possibiltes of the the things I could do from learning to write code seemed to be a good fit for the kind of person I am.</p>  
                         
              <p>Im looking forward to a bright future with a new set of skills that will drastically change my life for the better. I've been warned that the Bootcamp program is intensive and demanding. I am looking forward to the challeneges of each class, and learning about the inner workings of computer programming and the frustrating hours that come with it.</p></p>
